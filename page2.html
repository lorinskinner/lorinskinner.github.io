  <h3>History</h3>
  <p>After War World I when African Americans came back from fighting on the frontlines, they received mixed reactions. A group who has lost notoriety, Harlem Hellfighters, would be a prime example. Largely unheard of due to the systemic erasure of black history and stories, the Harlem Hellfighters served the most days in active combat. Black servicemen had surely deserved to redefine their deplorable characterization after risking their lives for the country and fighting well. Fighting for their manhood and personhood, many were inspired to fight back when racist uprisings and sentiments begin to spread like wildfire. Hundreds or lynchings plagued the country and began the Red Summer of 1919. This would politicize a lot of individuals, including the intellectuals who also fought back with their ideas. During the Great Migration millions of African Americans would move from the north to the south. The war and postwar had created a lot of industrialization and need for jobs. As well as many would flee the persecution and Jim Crow south. This increased the diverse population of many urban cities, like New York City and Harlem. A new black identity began to emerge and grow. The Talented Tenth became a popular idea that through education and ideas could bring social change. Many intellectual leaders grew during this period and perpetuated the idea of The New Negro.  Marcus Garvey was a popular thinker, where he believed in a Back to Africa movement where he embraced African roots which had often denied or misplaced in the forced assimilation to American culture. These ideas grew an overall sense of black pride and politicized a black nationalist movements, not far from what would become black panther. </p>
