One of the most popular clubs in Harlem was the <b>Cotton Club</b>.  <b>Cab Calloway</b> and <b>Duke Ellington</b>, two talented band leaders and musicians would be known associated acts there. They gained national exposure and the nightlife in Harlem grew. Vaudeville grew out of Minstrel Theater and both <b>Ma Rainey</b> and her protégé, <b>Bessie Smith</b>, would be famous for performing at these legendary spots. They both grew the blues and jazz scene in theater along with many other prominent artists and dancers. </p>
